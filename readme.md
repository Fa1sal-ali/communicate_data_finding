## by Faisal Ali


## Dataset

> The data consisted of 15 different variables such as age, gender, weekday, time and others. Our data is from 2017 of six months from June to December with 436822 rides. 75% of the users are below 45 age. There were users more than 100 years old. So, we can remove users more than 60 years old. Also, new fields were generated to make our analysis easier. Ford GoBike is available in multiple cities and we are focusing on San Francisco area.
